# Delighted-Android-Animation
This repository is for demo in Delighted Android Animation session in the upcoming event-Mobile Conf 2018 BKK.
In this project mainly focus how to apply animation in the list detail app, by adding:
1. Item in recycler view animation
2. Transit screen animation
3. Click bouncing animation

## Project Structure
According to the list above, in the project will have 4 steps, thus you can see the difference between the step. The steps are described like this:
1. Normal list - shows how to render item in list and link to detail of each item
2. Animate item in RecyclerView - adding animation when each item in the list appear
3. Transit item to banner - adding item transit to be a banner of next screen, and also transit back when user press back
4. Bouncing effect - adding a bounce effect when users touch on an item.
5. Bouncing effect KTX (Extra) - refactoring code by using Kotlin Extension function

## Code Architecture

## Disclaimer
This code is not a perfect example of a kickstart. It still needs to add some linter, DI, rules, and tools to keep code quality. But you still can follow the example about the animation.
